Writing programs or programming is a very creative
and rewarding activity. You can write programs for
a variety of reasons, ranging from making a living
to solving a complex data mining problem, to having
fun, to helping someone else solve a problem.

This book assumes that everyone needs to know how
to program and that once you know how to program,
you will figure out what you want to do with your
newfound skills.
